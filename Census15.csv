"1 A margin of error (MOE) is a measure of an estimate's variability. The larger the MOE in relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable the estimate. This number, when added to and subtracted from the estimate, forms the 90 percent confidence interval. MOEs shown in this table are based on standard errors calculated using replicate weights beginning with 2010. Before 2010, standard errors were calculated using the generalized variance function.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
